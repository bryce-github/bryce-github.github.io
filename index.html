      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Bryce Anglin</p>
      <p>bryce.anglin@gmail.com</p>
      <p>
        My initial career trajectory wasn't to become a
        software developer. My early interest in Aeronautics
        led me to an internship with NASA and a degree
        in Mechanical Engineering. I was introduced to
        programming in a later inernship, where I found
        myself using Python for a myriad of small projects.
        This sparked a passion that led me to being a
        full-time developer for the past few years. Today,
        I find myself leading a variety of software
        development projects and pursuing new opportunities
        for professional growth.
